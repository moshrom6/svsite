                <h2>Professions</h2>
                <p><span class="professions">Professions</span> are selected between 2 choices at <span class="skill">Skill Lvl.</span> (<span class="skill">level</span>) <span class="skill">5</span>, & 2 more at <span class="skill">Skill Lvl. 10</span> (for context, <span class="skill">Skills</span> are player attributes which are leveled up through the use of specific <span class="item">tools</span> or actions which provide <span class="skill">xp</span>, a.k.a. <span class="skill">experience points</span>, or by reading certain <span class="item">Books</span>). The <span class="professions">Professions</span> given to choose from at <span class="skill">Skill Lvl. 10</span> are based on what <span class="professions">Profession</span> was previously chosen at <span class="skill">Lvl. 5</span>, resulting in 4 potential <span class="professions">Professions</span> at <span class="skill">Lvl. 10</span> per <span class="skill">Skill</span> (something worth considering before deciding). Some <span class="professions">Professions</span> that seem helpful to me are shown below:</p>

                <h3>Skills & XP</h3>
                <p>Each <span class="skill">Skill</span> has <span class="skill">10 Lvls</span>. <span class="skill">Skills</span> must be leveled up with <span class="skill">xp</span>, requiring more <span class="skill">xp</span> per <span class="skill">Lvl.</span>, additively. For example, the <span class="item">Book Of Stars</span> provides <span class="skill">+250xp</span> for all 5 <span class="skill">Skills</span> when read. Below are a few ways to earn <span class="skill">xp</span> for each <span class="skill">Skill</span>:</p>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Farming Skill</dt>
                    <dd><span class="skill">Skill xp</span> for <span class="skill">Farming</span> is gained by harvesting <span class="item">crops</span>, pricier <span class="item">crops</span> giving more <span class="skill">xp</span>, by petting, milking, or shearing farm animals (<span class="skill">+5xp</span> each), or by picking up an <span class="item">animal product</span> inside a barn or coop (<span class="skill">+5xp</span>).</dd>
                    <dt>Foraging Skill</dt>
                    <dd>The <span class="skill">Foraging Skill</span> may be trained by gathering <span class="item">foraged items</span> found on the ground throughout Stardew Valley, by chopping down <span class="item">trees</span> with an <span class="item">Axe</span> (<span class="skill">+14xp</span>), as well as a few other ways. The most <span class="skill">xp</span>-rich actions, in regard to <span class="skill">Foraging</span>, are reading a copy of the <span class="item">Woodcutter's Weekly</span> (<span class="skill">+250xp</span>), removing <span class="item">large stumps</span> & <span class="item">large logs</span> (<span class="skill">+25xp</span>), destroying a <span class="item">large Green Rain weed</span> (<span class="skill">+15xp</span>), and digging up a Seed Spot or Artifact Spot (each <span class="skill">+15xp</span>).</dd>
                    <dt>Fishing Skill</dt>
                    <dd>Any <span class="item">trash</span>, <span class="item">green algae</span>, <span class="item">white algae</span>, <span class="item">seaweed</span>, <span class="item">river jelly</span>, <span class="item">sea jelly</span>, or <span class="item">cave jelly</span> caught with the <span class="item">fishing pole</span> provide +3xp each, and <span class="item">crab pots</span> provide <span class="skill">+5xp</span> each time they're collected from no matter what. <span class="skill">Fishing xp</span> gained from Fish Ponds works a bit differently (idk how yet). Otherwise, <span class="skill">xp</span> gained from <span class="item">fish</span> is calculated from a formula based on the <span class="item">fish's</span> quality & difficulty to catch. <span class="skill">Xp</span> is multiplied <em>x2.2</em> if the player also catches a treasure chest, <em>x2.4</em> if the catch was "perfect", and by <em>5</em> if the catch was a <span class="item">Legendary fish</span>. These multiplications stack (which is a big incentive for "perfect" catches, especially when combined with the other 2 multipliers)! Reading <span class="item">Bait And Bobber</span> also happens to increase <span class="skill">Fishing Skill</span> by <span class="skill">+250xp</span>.</dd>
                    <dt>Mining Skill</dt>
                    <dd><span class="skill">Mining Skill xp</span> may be gained from mining rocks, boulders, & nodes, varying in <span class="skill">xp</span> gain. Regular looking <span class="item">rocks</span> inside The Mines provide no <span class="skill">xp</span> on their own, but if <span class="item">coal</span> is dropped, <span class="skill">+5xp</span> is awarded. Each piece of <span class="item">ore</span> gained from panning with a <span class="item">pan</span> provides <span class="skill">one xp</span>.</dd>
                    <dt>Combat Skill</dt>
                    <dd><span class="skill">Combat xp</span> is increased by fighting various monsters (with varying <span class="skill">xp</span> gain). Look out for any Putrid Ghosts (<span class="skill">+25xp</span> when killed) or Iridium Bats (<span class="skill">+22xp</span> when killed), as they provide the most <span class="skill">Combat xp</span> when slain. Carbon Ghosts, Iridium Crabs, Mummies, Serpent/Royal Serpents, Tiger Slimes & Shadow Snipers each provide <span class="skill">+20xp</span> each when slain, making them worth murdering as well :D. Reading a copy of <span class="item">Combat Quarterly</span> provides <span class="skill">+250xp</span>.</dd>
                </dl>
                <h3>Mastery</h3>
                <p>Once <span class="skill">max Lvl.</span> (<span class="skill">Lvl. 10</span>) in all <span class="skill">Skills</span> have been reached, a door in Cindersap Forest may be used to enter the <span class="mastery">Mastery Cave</span>. Here, any extra <span class="skill">xp</span> may be used to increase <span class="mastery">Mastery Points</span>. Keep in mind, <span class="skill">Farming xp</span> only contributes to <span class="mastery">Mastery Points</span> at a 50% rate, while <span class="skill">xp</span> for the rest of the <span class="skill">Skills</span> contribute to the Mastery Points at a normal 100% rate. Good luck, <span class="mastery">Master</span> :P</p>

                <h2>Crops</h2>
                <p>The tables I've made display some <span class="item">crops</span> I'm considering, categorized by season. Each <span class="item">crop</span> has a condition(s) I've made for farming it, as well as an estimate of the <span class="gold-currency">gold</span> gained per day (for an individual <span class="item">crop</span>). The formula, <code><span class="gold-currency">gold</span> per day = ((max harvests * <span class="gold-currency">sell price</span> per harvest) − <span class="item">seed</span> <span class="gold-currency">price</span>) / Growing Days</code>, is used to calculate the <span class="gold-currency">gold</span> per day made from each <span class="item">crop</span> (this formula does not factor in the <span class="professions">Tiller</span> <em>or</em> <span class="professions">Agriculturist Professions</span>, <span class="item">crop</span> quality, or <span class="item">fertilizer</span>).

                <p>There are various animals in Stardew Valley, including unobtainable wildlife, hostile entities, a pet chosen while creating a character, a rideable horse, and farm animals that produce resources. A <span class="item">Pet License</span> may be obtained from Marnie's Ranch to adopt more pets after reaching max frienship with your first pet.</p>
                <h2>Farm Animals</h2>
                <p>Farm Animals may be raised in a coop, a barn, or a slime hutch (to raise slimes)</p>
                <h3>Coop Animals</h3>
                <p>These animals require a coop to live in. They'll leave their products inside the coop each morning, leaving better produce based on how happy they are. There are 4 unique coop animals (excluding the variants of chickens):</p>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Blue / Brown / White Chickens</dt>
                    <dd>These regular chickens may be purchased from Marnie's Ranch for 800<span class="gold-currency">g</span> (except void & Golden chickens, they cannot be bought), or hatched by placing an <span class="item">egg</span> into an <span class="item">incubator</span> (takes roughly 6d 16h in-game to incubate). After seeing Shane's 8-heart event, each Chicken purchaced from Marnie's Ranch has a 25% chance of being Blue. Produces a white/brown <span class="item">egg</span>/<span class="item">large egg</span> every day, depending on its color (Blue Chickens produce White <span class="item">eggs</span>/<span class="item">large eggs</span>).</dd>
                    <dt>Void Chickens</dt>
                    <dd>Void chickens live in a Big Coop. The only way to obtain a void chicken is through incubating a <span class="item">void egg</span>. There are 3 ways to obtain a <span class="item">void egg</span>: 1. Through a random event involving a Witch (she's a nice Witch), 2. Purchacing one from Krobus for 5,000<span class="gold-currency">g</span>, or 3. Shane gifting a <span class="item">void egg</span> after marrying him.

After reaching Perfection, A <span class="item">golden egg</span> may be purchased from Marnie's Ranch for 100,000<span class="gold-currency">g</span>, or from Qi's Walnut Room for 100something (idk what currency yet). Also (after Perfection), A Witch may leave a <span class="item">golden egg</span> in a coop overnight, and <span class="item">fishing treasure chests</span> may contain them at this point in the game.

An adult Rabbit produces <span class="item">wool</span> every 4 days, with a chance of producing a <span class="item">rabbit's foot</span> if sufficient Friendship & Happiness is reached.</dd>
                    <dt>Dinosaurs</dt>
                    <dd>Dinosaurs require a Big Coop. To obtain a Dino, a <span class="item">dinosaur egg</span> must be found, and then placed in an <span class="item">incubator</span>. In approximately 12.5 in-game days, a Dino will hatch. Dinos like any other coop animal, but they are silent, and may lay a <span class="item">dinosaur egg</span> worth 350<span class="gold-currency">g</span> every 7 days.</dd>
                    <dd>A <span class="item">dinosaur egg</span> may be found in various ways: By digging up an Artifact Spot in The Mountains (including the Quarry), in <span class="item">fishing treasure chests</span> after reaching <span class="skill">Fishing Lvl. 2</span> (and having previously found at least one <span class="item">artifact</span>), dropped from a Pepper Rex, foraged on Prehistoric Floors in the Skull Cavern, or won in the Crane Game in the Movie Theater.

Collection will be affected by <span class="skill">Foraging Skill</span>, <em>not</em> <span class="skill">Farming Skill</span>. Pigs don't leave the Barn come Winter time, therefore they will not find any <span class="item">truffles</span> during Winter. Pigs have a 0.2% chance to dig up a Truffle Crab instead of a Truffle.</dd>
                    <dt>Ostriches</dt>
                    <dd>Lives in any sized Barn. Ostriches can be hatched by placing an <span class="item">ostrich egg</span> into an <span class="item">ostrich incubator</span>, taking 9d 10h in-game to incubate. Ostriches produce an <span class="item">ostritch egg</span> every 7 days.</dd>
                    <dd>An <span class="item">ostrich egg</span> can be initially found by solving Journal Scrap #10, or as a random drop from the <span class="item">chests</span> in the Volcano Dungeon.</dd>

                <p><span class="item">Artisan goods</span> are <span class="item">items</span> that can be created using <span class="item">artisan equipment</span>. They can take anywhere from a few hrs to a few days (in-game) to be processed.

Although <span class="item">cloth</span> does not have a star quality itself, it is affected by the quality of the <span class="item">wool</span> used, with higher quality <span class="item">wool</span> resulting in higher chances to produce 2 <span class="item">cloth</span> instead of 1.</p>

                <h2>Cooking</h2>
                <p>Cooking is a game mechanic that becomes available after upgrading The Farmhouse for the first time. After reaching <span class="skill">Foraging Lvl. 3</span>, a <span class="item">cookout kit</span> may be used to cook a <span class="item">dish</span> anywhere.</p>
                <p>For food in general (within Stardew Valley), only one food’s buffs can be active at a time, so eating a food with buffs will wipe out any active food buffs and replace them with the buffs from the newly eaten food. If a newly eaten food has no buffs, any existing buffs will remain in effect. Drink buffs are handled separately, so buffs from one drink (<span class="item">Triple Shot Espresso</span>, <span class="item">Coffee</span>, <span class="item">Green Tea</span> or <span class="item">Ginger Ale</span>) can be stacked with one food’s buffs. Using <span class="item">Qi seasoning</span> positively impacts various aspects of <span class="item">dishes</span>.</p>
                <p>A minimum of 88 different types of <span class="item">items</span> are needed to cook all 81 <span class="item">dishes</span> in the game, including:</p>

                <p>They may just look like little wriggling worms, but these Artifact Spots are guaranteed to provide an <span class="item">item</span> when dug up with a <span class="item">hoe</span> (other <span class="item">tools</span> do not work). Artifact Spots can be found in various tillable (but fallow) tiles on maps all over Stardew Valley, including Ginger Island. The possible contents of an Artifact Spot are controlled by the map where it is located. Up to 16 Spots can also be created in a given area by using a <span class="item">treasure totem</span>.

                <h2>Villagers</h2>
                <p>Villagers are NPCs in Stardew Valley. They are citizens who live in and around Pelican Town. Each Villager has a daily routine, so they can be located in different sections of town depending on the in-game time of the day and weather. You may/may not give various <span class="item">items</span> as gifts to a certain Villager, and may/may not marry certain Villagers, as well. Each Villager has unique likes & dislikes, and will respond to gifts differently. A sortable table of gifts relevant to each Villager in Stardew Valley may be found <a class="reference" href="https://stardewvalleywiki.com/List_of_All_Gifts" target="_blank">here</a>. Villagers also sometimes provide quests.</p>
                <h3>Universally Loved Gifts</h3>
                <p><em>Universally loved gifts</em> are <span class="item">items</span> that are guaranteed each villager <em>loves</em> to receive as a gift, with a couple exceptions. These <span class="item">items</span> are guaranteed to give the most friendship points (+80), but may be difficult to obtain. In general, when given a <em>loved</em> gift, villagers usually respond with a heart dialogue bubble. A <span class="item">Golden Pumpkin</span>, <span class="item">Magic Rock Candy</span>, <span class="item">Pearl</span>, <span class="item">Prismatic Shard</span>, & <span class="item">Rabbit's Foot</span> are <em>universally loved gifts</em>, with the exception of Haley <em>hating</em> <span class="item">Prismatic Shards</span>, and Penny <em>hating</em> <span class="item">Rabbit's Feet</span>. <span class="item">Stardrop Tea</span> grants +250 friendship points (equal to +1 heart) when given to any villager, and is not subjected to the weekly gift limit. If given on a villager's birthday (or at the Feast of the Winter Star) it gives +750 points (+3 hearts).</p>

                        <p>"Try to find what excites you and speaks to your heart, then work on finding the best way to build and share it. There is no 'secret' to success, you just need to have a ton of dedication, determination, and a 'can do' attitude. Ask yourself, 'if someone else can do it, why can’t I?' Most importantly, never give up!"</p>
